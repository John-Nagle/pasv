.HU "J-graphs and J-code"We divide the problem of generating verification conditions intotwo parts.We first translate the program to be verified into a representation wecall a J-graph, and then trace out the paths in the J-graph.We have defined a textual language we call J-code which is used torepresent J-graphs.  The decompiling pass of the verifier generates J-codefrom Icode.  The path tracer then parses J-code and builds a J-graph, thentraverses the J-graph to produce verification conditions..PThe J-graph is best thought of as a nondeterministic loop-free program.J-graphs contain the primitives .B NEW\c,.B SPLIT\c,.B WHEN\c,.B BRANCH\c,.B JOIN\c,.B HANG\c, and.B REQUIRE..PThe .B NEWinstruction is a nondeterministic, simultaneous assignment statement.The format of a.B NEWinstructionis.DS	NEW  	<variable-list> <formula>	..DEWhen a NEW instruction is executed, the variables in the .I <variable-list>are upated in such a way as to make the.I <formula>true.If .I vis a formula in the variable list, the notation .I v.oldmay be used to denote the value of the variable before the.I NEWinstruction is executed..PAssignment statements and procedure calls are translated to .I NEWinstructions in a straightforward fashion.  For example, the assignmentstatement:.DS	X := X + 1.DEis translated to:.DS	NEW (X) (X = X.OLD+1).DETo translate a procedure call, the decompiler determines every variable whichcould be modified as a result of the call, either by direct modification orthrough side effects.This list of variable forms the <variable-list>of the.B NEWinstruction.The <formula> is derived from the .B EXITcondition declared with the procedure..PThe .B SPLIT\c,.B WHEN\c,.B BRANCH\c, and.B JOINinstructions are used to model flow of control in J-graphs..B SPLITand.B WHENare used when the flow of control forks off in different directions, and.B BRANCHand .B JOINare used when it comes back together again.  This notation merely allows us to represent a loop-free flowchart in a linear fashion.As an example,.DS	IF X > Y THEN M := X ELSE M := M + 1;.DEwould be represented by.DS	SPLIT 	1	WHEN X > Y    1	NEW (M) (M = X)	BRANCH     2	WHEN NOT (X > Y)    1	NEW (M) (M = M.old + 1)	BRANCH 2	JOIN 2.DEAll similarly numbered statements are considered to be connected..PThe .B REQUIREstatement is used to put verification goals into J-graphs.The format of a.B REQUIREinstruction is.DS	REQUIRE <formula>	..DEWhenever we must prove that some formula is always true when control reachessome point in a program, we put a .B REQUIRE instruction containing that formulaat the corresponding point in the J-graph.For each.B REQUIREstatement,the path tracer will trace out all paths from the .B REQUIRE statement back tothe beginning of the program, and for each path, it will generate and submitto the theorem prover a verification condition..PFinally, the .R HANGinstruction terminates a path.  An execution path which reaches a HANGinstruction is not continued past that instruction. .PJ-graphs must be loop-free.  Every execution path which starts at the beginningof the J-graph must be traced forward to a HANG instruction without reachingany instruction in the graph more than once.  Since we require users to writeloop invariants for all loops, we are able to break the loop at the invariantand thus end up with a loop-free graph.  For the program fragment.DS	REPEAT	  s1;	  INVARIANT p;	  s2;	  UNTIL b;.DEwhere.I s1and.I s2are blocks of code,.I pis the loop invariant, and.I bis a boolean expression,the corresponding J-code is.DS	SPLIT 	1	WHEN TRUE	1	BRANCH 	2	WHEN TRUE	1	NEW (<list-of-variables-changed-in-loop>) p	<J-code for s2>	SPLIT 	3	WHEN NOT b	3	BRANCH 	2	JOIN 	2	<J-code for s1>	REQUIRE p	SPLIT 	4	JOIN 	4	HANG	WHEN b	3.DE(The graph has been simplified for clarity by the omission of the statements usually presentfor proof of loop termination.)The loop invariant is proved by induction on the number of times the loop bodyis executed.For the base case of the induction, we must show that .I pis satisfied when the.B INVARIANTstatement is reached on the first execution of the loop body. This case is handled by the path which goes back from the REQUIRE throughthe J-code for s1, the.B "JOIN 2\c", the first .B "BRANCH 2"and back to the beginning of the program.For the induction step, we must show that if.I pholds when the.B INVARIANTstatement in the original program,then when the .B INVARIANTis reached again, P will still hold.This case is handled by the path from the.B REQUIREback through the.B "JOIN 2\c", the second.B "BRANCH 2\c",.B "WHEN NOT b\c", the J-code for s2, the.B "NEW"statement, and back through the.B "WHEN TRUE 1"and .B "SPLIT 1"to the beginning of the program.Finally, the path taken by the final execution of the loop body is represented by the path starting at the end of the J-code fragmentand continuing back via the .B "WHEN b 3"statement, through the loop invariant in the .B "NEW"statement, and eventually back to the beginning of the program..PThe J-graph thus generatedcaptures the semantics of the original program.It is worth noting that our implementation generates J-code by a process very similar tothat used for generating machine code in a compiler.The process of generating J-code is much more amenable to such treatmentthan that of directly generating verification conditions, and allows us todraw heavily on techniques from compiler technology in our verifierimplementation..P.HU "Verification Condition Generation"The semantics of the language having been captured in the J-graph,the task of the verification condition generator is primarily that oftracing out all paths back from every REQUIRE statement back to the beginningof the J-graph and generating verification conditions during the process.The verification condition formally expresses the proposition``If this path is taken through the program then the formula on the.B REQUIREinstruction will be satisfied.``.As soon as the path tracer generates a verification condition, it passesthe formula to the theorem prover.  If the theorem prover cannot simplifythe formula to TRUE, the path tracer displays a diagnostic messagesimilar to the one below..DS    Could not prove {subscerr.pf:12}         (i + 1) - 1 <= 99    (subscript check for "tab" 1..100)     for path:        {subscerr.pf:5} Start of "examine"         {subscerr.pf:8} IF->THEN         {subscerr.pf:7} IF->THEN .DEThe error messageidentifyies the point in the program at which the .B REQUIRE was generated, the proof goal of the.B "REQUIRE\c", andthe explaination as to why the.B REQUIREwas generated, and the path being traced.The user is not ordinarily exposed to the verification condition itself.Our experience is that the above information is usually sufficient to allowthe user to correct the problem..PThe actual verification condition is constructed from formulae on the.B "WHEN\c", .B "NEW\c", and .B "REQUIRE\c" statements and the path.  The first step of the constructioninvolves renaming of variables.  A unique name is invented for each of thevariables in the variable lists of.B NEWinstructions along the path.Then one of these unique names is substituted for every variable in everyformula on the path.  If.I vis a variable in a formula, to find the unique name to be substituted for.I v\c,search back along the path for the first.B NEWinstruction that has .I vin its variable list.The unique name associated with.I vin that instruction is used..PSpecial attention is required when.I voccurs in both the variable list and formula of a .B NEWinstruction.Recall that .I vreferes to the value of the variable after the .B NEWis executed, and .I v.oldrefers to the value of the variable before the .B NEWis executed.  Therefore, the unique name for.I v is taken from the .B "NEW\c", while the unique name for .I "v.old"is taken from the previous .B NEWinstruction on the path mentioning .I vin its variable list..PAfter all the variables have been renamed, the verification conditionis simply.DS	p1 and p2 and ... pn implies q.DEwhere.I qis the formula in the .B REQUIREbeing processed,and the terms .I p1....I pnare the formulas on all the other instructions on this path.  It is notstrictly necessary to include among the .I pterms formulas from .B REQUIREinstructions passed over during backwards tracing, but we do so to stopthe user from getting an avalanche of diagnostics that all result froma single error.  In effect, after a .B REQUIREis passed, it is assumed to be true.  This is valid since the graph isloop-free.  It is also very effective in reducing the number of diagnosticmessages and in speeding up the proofs..HU "Optimizing verification conditions"The major motivation for our approach to verification condition generationis the ability to provide good diagnostics.  However, the generation ofa separate verification condition for every.B REQUIRE\c/pathpair is expensive, since the number of paths is exponential in the size ofthe graph.Fortunately, we have discovered some techniques to reduce theamount of computation required to process a J-graph..PThe first optimzation we call ``NEW balancing''.  We define a graph tobe NEW balanced if for every variable.I vand point.I Pin the graph, every path from the beginning of the graph to Pcontains the same number of .B NEW instructions with .I vin their variable lists.If a graph is NEW-balanced, the path tracer does not have to perform arenaming operation each time it processes a verification condition.Instead, renaming need only be performed only once, before any verificationconditions are generated..P
