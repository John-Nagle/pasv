The variable NextString containsthe lowest index of StringPool that has not been allocatedto a string..H 3 "The Label Table".DS.TScenter;l.TYPE LabelType = (SplitWhen, BranchJoin);     LabelNode = RECORD       LabelVal: Integer;       (* The label in question *)       Class: LabelType;        (* The "type" of the label *)       One, Many: ^Jnode;       (* Pointers to Jnodes with this label *)       HowMany: Integer;        (* The length of the Many list *)       BucketMate: ^LabelNode;  (* Hash bucket list *)       END;VAR LabelTable: ARRAY [1..LabelTableSize] OF ^LabelNode;    MaxLabelBucket: 0..LabelTableSize;.TE.DEThe Label Table is used during the StartGraph phase to connect upJnodes that have the same label.An open hash table is used, keyed on the numeric value of the label.Since label values are supposed to be contiguous, a simple modulus schemeis used to map labels onto hash buckets..PThere are two "types" of labels: those that go on SPLIT and WHENinstructions, and those that are used with BRANCH and JOIN.The One field points to the Jnode containing the defining instanceof the label (the SplitN or JoinN node), and the Many field points toa list of Jnodes (linked through the BranchMate or WhenMate fields)that reference the label.  The HowMany field contains the lengthof the Many list..PIn many cases the LabelTable will only be partially full.The variable MaxLabelBucket is used to keep track of the highestslot used so that when the table is traversed, the entire arrayneed not be searched..H 3 "The Enviornment Pool".DS.TScenter;l.CONST Instance = 0 .. 1295; (* 1295 = 36*36-1 *)      EnvIndex = 1 .. NewPoolSize;VAR   EnvPool: ARRAY[EnvPoolSize] OF Instance;      NextEnv: EnvIndex;      EnvLength: Integer;.TE.DEThe purpose of the NEW instruction is to advance the instancenumbers of some program variables.It is assumed that the instance number of a variable canbe encoded in two extra characters appended to variable names.In various parts of the J-graph, it is necessaryto keep a vector of the current instance numberThese vectors are called "enviornments."  They are representedby a pointer into NewPool.If X is an EnvIndex, the instance numbers for a variable whoseindex is V is retrieved by EnvPool[X+V].All enviornments are the same lengththe same length (EnvLength), though that length is a functionof the J-unit being processed.NextEnv is the first unused EnvIndex in the pool..H 3 "Variables".DS.TScenter;l.TYPE VariableIndex = Integer;     Variable = RECORD       Name: StringIndex;       Type: StringIndex;       Index: VariableIndex;     (* Used to consecutively number variables *)        BucketMate: ^Variable;    (* Used by hash lookup *)       StatusStack: ^StatusNode; (* Used during VC generation *)       Next,Previous: ^Variable; (* Used to doubly link the LiveList *)       END;     VariableList = RECORD      (* A linked list of variables *)       Head: ^Variable;       Tail: ^VariableList;       END;     Status = (Live, Dead);     CONST BitBlockSize = 32;TYPE StatusNode = RECORD        (* Used to maintain a stack of bits using linked blocks *)       BitCount: 1..BitBlockSize;       BitBlock: PACKED ARRAY [1..BitBlockSize] OF Status;       Pop: ^StatusNode;       END;VAR  VariableTable = ARRAY[1..VariableTableSize] OF ^Variable;.TE.DEThe Variable Table is used toassociate variables with their types and a numeric index.Variable indices are assigned sequentially, starting at zero.A hash function is used to map variable names to an entry inthe VariableTable; all the variables that map to a particularentry are linked through their BucketMate fields..DS.TScenter;l.TYPE Jtags = (NewN, SplitN, WhenN, BranchN, JoinN, RequireN, HangN, BreakN);Jnode = RECORD Next, Previous, SimLink: ^Jnode; (* see below *)  Jtag: Jtags OF  CASE NewN:     (NewLiveVars, NewDeadVars): VariableList;      NewState: StringIndex);  (* assertion from NEW instruction *)  CASE SplitN:     (SplitEnv: EnvIndex); (* see below *)  CASE WhenN:     (WhenMate: ^Jnode;      WhenNewVars: VariableList;      Constraint: StringIndex); (* assertion from WHEN instruction *)  CASE BranchN:     (BranchMate,             (* used to link successors *)      DirectDominator: ^Jnode;      Pathname: StringIndex;  (* string from BRANCH instruction *)  CASE JoinN:     (JoinEnv: EnvIndex; (* see below *)      TraverseCount,     (* used by NewBalance *)      InDegree:          (* number of predecessors *)         Integer);  Case RequireN:     (Requirement: StringIndex;  (* Assertion that is supposed to hold *)      ErrMsg:      StringIndex); (* Message to print if it doesn't *)  CASE HangN: ();  CASE BreakN: ();  END;.TE.DEThe Next and Previous fields of a J-node point tothe successor and predecessors of the node.A successor of a J-node is one that occursimmediately after its predecessor in execution order.A HangN node has no successor; its successor field is nil.A split node can have more than one successor.Its Successor field points to the first element of a listof WhenN nodes that are linked through their WhenMate fields.Likewise, JoinN nodes have more than one predecessor.The Predecessor field of a JoinN node points to a listof BranchN nodes linked through their BranchMate fields.
