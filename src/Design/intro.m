Read only..LI "Source Lines"A file of source lines indexed in such a way that any line can beretrieved by line number.  This file exists to allowretrieval of program text for use in diagnostic messages of later phases.Write only in this phase..LI "Dictionary"A file of named objects, indexed by name and scope, containing theproperties of the objects.  This file is a representation of thecompiler's dictionary.  Created in this phase..LI "Routine Database"A file of routines and properties thereof.This information includes.BL.LIThe list of procedures and functions directly called by each procedureand function.LIThe list of imported variables directlyreferenced by each procedure and function..LIThe list of imported variables directlyaltered by each procedure and function..LIThe entry and exit assertions of each procedure and function..LIThe invariants of each module and monitor..LIThe priority of each procedure, function, monitor, and module..LIThe containing monitor or module of each procedure, function, monitor, andmodule..LIFor each procedure and function, answers to the questions:.AL.LIDoes the routine perform a ``wait'' operation?.LIDoes the routine perform a ``send'' operation?.LE.LE.PThis list maynot be complete.  Because the final definition of the Pascal-F languagehas not been received, it is not yet possible to be sure thatall required information about routines is listed above..PCreated in this phase..LI "``Icode''"The reverse Polish form of the program text.  A sequential file,readable forward only.  Created in this phase..LI "Error Messages"User-readable error messages.

The description of a routine in augmentedJcode stands alone; no information external to the Jcode is requiredto define the information to be proven about the routine.If the augmented Jcode of a routine does not changefrom one verification attempt to the next, there is no need to reverify theroutine..H 3 "Phase 3B -- Verification Condition Generation".DS					    *--------*			  *-------------*   |Source  |			  |             |   |Line    |			  |  Error      |-->|File    |			  |  Message    |   *--------*			  |  Generator  |			  |             |-->*--------*			  *-------------*   |Error   |				^           |Messages|				|           *--------*				|				|       *---------*    *---------------*       |Augmented|    |               |        *--------*       |Jcode    |--->|  VC Generator |        |Proved  |       |File     |    |  Supervisor   |<------>|Routines|       *---------*    |               |        |Database|		      *---------------*        *--------*			^            |			|            v			|      *--------------*			|      |              |			|      |    Path      |			|      |  Traverser   |			|      |              |			|      *--------------*			|             |			|             v			|   *---------------------*			|   |                     |			|   |    Verification     |			|   |     Condition       |			|   |     Generator       |			|   |                     |		   error|   *---------------------*		messages|             |		    from|             |formulae		 theorem|             |to be proven		 proving|             v.FG "Phase 3B - Verification Condition Generation".DE.PIt is the task of this phase to generate the verification conditionsfor which proof will be attempted.This phase interacts directlywith the next phase, in that each verificationcondition, as it is generated, is submitted to the theorem prover, so thatthe success or failure of the proof is immediately available to theverification condition generator supervisor..PInputs and outputs of this phase are as follows:.VL 22 2.LI "Jcode file"Read only in this phase..LI "Proved Routines"This database is used to avoid reverification of unchanged routines.If the augmented Jcode for a routine has not changed since the lastverification attempt, verification condition generation and theorem provingare ommitted..PThe error messages generated during theorem proving are saved in thisdatabase, so that reverification attempts produce the same error messagesas previous tries..LI "Source Line File"Read-only in this phase..LI "Error Messages"Standard output..LE.H 2 "CPCI #4: Theorem Proving".DS			^             v		   error|             |formulae to		messages|             |be proven		    from|             |		  prover|             |			|   __________|			|   |			|   |			|   v	    *------------------*	    |   Theorem        |	    |   Prover         |	    |   Supervisor     |	    *------------------*		^           ^		|           |		v           v	    *--------*   *--------------------*	    |Proved  |   |                    |	    |Theorems|   |   Theorem Prover   |	    |Database|   |                    |	    *--------*   *--------------------*.FG "Theorem Proving Phase".DE.PInputs and outputs of this phase are as follows:.VL 22 2.LI "VC file"Read only in this phase..LI "Proved Theorems"A dictionary of proved theorems used to avoid resubmittingalready-proved (or disproved) conjectures to the theorem prover.This database is preserved from run to run of the verifier as a fileassociated with the program being verified.Read/write in this phase; may be created empty if nonexistent..LI "Error Stream"Error messages.
