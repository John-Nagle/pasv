"@(#)newsplit.l	2.2"; This file contiains the functions that perform new splitting.  The; entry point is the function:; ;    (newsplit 'varlist 'formula); ; where varlist is a list of atoms, and formula is a J-code formula.; The input represents a new instruction.  At this point in the processing,; occurrences of (new! x) will have been replaced by decorations at the; end of the variable; the symbols in varlist should be decorated in the; same fashion.; ; Newsplit breaks the new into one or more equivalent instructions, and; sends the result back over the port to-vcg.  The format used to send a; new back is (1) a list of variables (without parentheses), one to a; line, followed by the formula, all on one line.  This is unambiguous,; because the formula always begins with a paren, and variables never; begin with a paren.  A series of new instructions are sent; the end of; the expressions is signalled by a line containing a slash.(declare (load 'need.o) (load 'hunkshell.o) (load 'match.o))(needs-macros)(declare (special newvars to-vcg))(defun newsplit (newvars form)  ; New spliting works as follows.

Each conjunct is scanned, all the newed variables are  ; located, and the equivalence class containing the conjuct is merged  ; into the equivalence class containing each of its newed variables.  ; After all the conjucts have been scanned, a new instruction is  ; generated for each equivalence class.
