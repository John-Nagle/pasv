;	Normalization preprocessing
;
;					Version 2.9 of 6/1/83
;
; Normalization is performed on incoming VCs before they are submitted
; to the prover proper.
; The normalizing function performs the following tasks:
;
; 1)  Several simple translations from Jcode notation to simplifier
;     notation are performed.
;
; 2)  If (f a b c ...) is a call to a user function f, the
;     normalizer inserts type information, translating the formula into the
;     form (type! f a b c ...).  Note that user variables are encoded as
;     functions with no operands.  Type information is also inserted before
;     the operators selecta! selectr! storea! and storer!.
;
; It should be noted that the output of normalize may not be fed to normalize.
; Normalize will not process expressions containing "typed!"
