The Pascal-F Verifier

The Pascal-F Veriifer is an early proof-of-correctness system.
It was developed between 1982 and 1985 and works on a dialect
of Pascal used for real-time programming.

It ran on UNIX 4.x BSD on early VAX and Sun systems in the 1980s.
The plan is to bring it back to life as a milestone in the history
of program verification.
